# <My PreWork Study Guide>

## Description

I recently qualified to become a primary teacher but after such a bad experience in my first job I ended up quitting. After quitting I started looking into other career paths I could take and came across some coding/development courses. I was reasonably confident in my computer skills so I tried a short 5 day taster course and loved it!! That lead me to sign up for this course.

I created this study guide to help me retain and remember all of the knowledge and information I will be learning throughout the course. It will hopefully help me when I get find myself struggling to decode in the future. I learnt a bit about Github and how to save coding files and how to use Git Bash alongsde VS code.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
